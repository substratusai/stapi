## Install
There are 2 options to install STAPI: Docker or local Python install.

### Install (Docker)
Run the API locally using Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d ghcr.io/substratusai/stapi
```

### Install (Local python)
Install and run the API server locally using Python. Only supports python 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/substratusai/stapi
cd stapi
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the webserver:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --port 8080 --reload
```

## Usage
After you've installed STAPI,
you can visit the API docs on [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)

You can also use CURL to get embeddings:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Your text string goes here",
    "model": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  }'
```

Even the OpenAI Python client can be used to get embeddings:
```python
import openai
openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8080/v1"
openai.api_key = "this isn't used but openai client requires it"
model = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input="Some text", model=model)["data"][0]["embedding"]
print(embedding)
```

## Supported Models
Any model that's supported by Sentence Transformers should also work as-is
with STAPI.
Here is a list of [pre-trained models](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) available with Sentence Transformers.

By default the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model is used and preloaded on startup. You
can preload any supported model by setting the `MODEL` environment variable.

For example, if you want to preload the `multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`, you
could tweak the `docker run` command like this:
```bash
docker run -e MODEL=multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1  -p 8080:8080 -d \
  ghcr.io/substratusai/sentence-transformers-api
```

In addition to preloading models, you can also specify other models at runtime. A single
API endpoint can serve multiple models in parallel.

## Integrations
It's easy to utilize the embedding server with various other tools because
the API is compatible with the OpenAI Embedding API.
